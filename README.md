## User Story

Robot Gladiators is a browser-based video game that we'll enter in a fictional hackathon called the Con Solo Game Jam, which has the following rules:

- The game must be created by a single developer in 24 hours.
- The game must run in a web browser.
- The game must use the provided index.html file.
- Only the <title> element of index.html may be changed.
- Participants cannot use CSS.
- All game code must be contained in the game.js JavaScript file.
- Extra points will be given for high-quality code

We'll prioritize the development tasks necessary to create a minimal viable product, or MVP. An MVP is the simplest version of an app that a developer can share with players to get their feedback.
